    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You are working for a pharmaceutical company that is interested in understanding the antimicrobic property of various molecules as a function of their respective three-dimensional (3D) structures. A preprocessing step involves transforming the 3D structure of each molecule to a computer-readable, numerical format (features). One such transformation method is to use an approach called the Coloumb matrix that mimics the electrostatic interaction between the nuclei of the atoms in a molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coulomb matrix (M) is calculated using the equation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    M_{ij}^\\mathrm{Coulomb}=\\left\\{\n",
    "        \\begin{matrix}\n",
    "        0.5 Z_i^{2.4} & \\text{for } i = j \\\\\n",
    "            \\frac{Z_i Z_j}{R_{ij}} & \\text{for } i \\neq j\n",
    "        \\end{matrix}\n",
    "        \\right.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $M_{ij}$ are the elements of the matrix, $Z_i$ (or $Z_j$) represents the atomic number of the atom $i$ (or $j$) in the molecule, and $R_{ij}$ is the distance between atom $i$ and atom $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that accepts a python dictionary containing the molecule information (elements, their respective atomic numbers, 3D Cartesian coordinates in Angstrom), and returns the corresponding Coulomb matrix. Test the function you wrote on the dictionary of a water and a benzene molecule given in the cell below. For example, since the water molecule has three atoms, i.e. 2 H and 1 O atoms, your function should output a 3$\\times$3 matrix, where the diagonal elements contain the information for the $i=j$ case, while the off-diagonal elements contain the information for the $i \\neq j$ case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One important feature of the transformation method is that it should produce the same output even when the molecule is rotated. This is because the property of the molecule does not change if it is rotated and hence, the transformation method should yield the same features (in this case the same matrix). Does Coulomb matrix satisfy this rule?"
