They have asked you to understand the factors affecting the pricing of coffee grinders in the Swedish market, since they expect it to be different from the Italian market.\n","\n","They have handed you a dataset pertinent to the Swedish market (coffee_grinder.xlsx) that contains the following 5 variables:\n","\n","- name: Name of the grinder.\n","- size: The size of the motor that goes in the grinder (scaled units).\n","- power: The power associated with the motor (watts).\n","- time100: time taken by the grinder to grind 1 kg of coffee beans at 100% motor operation (seconds).\n","- price: the price of the grinder (swedish krone).\n","\n","Given these variables, you are required to apply linear regression to model the price of coffee grinders. Your model will help Lavazza to understand how the prices depend on various features and determine which independent variables are significant. They can then design a new coffee grinder for the Swedish market.\n","\n","Here's a template that assigns several tasks for you and also provides a roadmap to guide you.
